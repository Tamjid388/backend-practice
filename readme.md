# Backend Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **backend development practice projects**, built using different stacks and tools to explore and strengthen my server-side skills.  

It includes projects with:

- **Core Node.js** – Implemented basic backend concepts, including modules, file handling, events, and asynchronous programming.  
- **Express.js** – Built RESTful APIs, middleware, routing, and server-side logic using the Express framework.  
- **MongoDB with Mongoose** – Implemented schema-based MongoDB applications using Mongoose for data modeling, validation, and CRUD operations.  
- **PostgreSQL with Node.js (pg)** – Created relational database applications, including table creation, relationships, and queries using PostgreSQL.  
- **TypeScript** – Enhanced JavaScript projects with static typing, interfaces, and type safety for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.  

This collection showcases my hands-on experience in both **NoSQL and SQL backend development**, along with practical exposure to REST APIs, database management, and server-side architecture.
